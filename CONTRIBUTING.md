## Pull Request Guidelines

- Include tests for new functionality
- Make sure all existing tests pass
- Update documentation if your change affects user-facing behavior
- Write a clear PR description explaining what and why

## Code Style

- Follow existing code conventions in the project
- Use Swift's standard naming conventions (camelCase for functions/variables, PascalCase for types)
- Keep functions focused and reasonably short
- Use Swift concurrency (async/await, actors) for concurrent code
